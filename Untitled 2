*** EQUESTRIAN WEEK-END IN FRANCE ***

** WHY? 3 GOOD REASONS **
1. Good fun, good food, fresh air, adventure, friendly and adequate, down-to-earth team member; a break from the world of abstractions.
2. Fitting for you: "management" comes from Italian "maneggiare", which means "to handle", especially "to control a horse". 
3. Doubles as a "sejour linguistique" :)

** WHERE? ALSACE, NORMANDIE, AQUITAINE, ... **

I have found a few options, see if there is anything that you like/can fit into your schedule.
Since you have not done any cantor before, it needs to be a "beginners" level, but you are likely to have a cantor by the end of the week-end.
Typically all options start at 9am on Saturday, but it *might* be possible to arrive a bit later.
Possible to have a week-end "a la carte" (same program but different days, possible to ask once the dates are known).
The helmet will be provided for most options below (best to double-check); no other special equipment is required.
I recommend to wear gloves, as the hands can blister very easily (also good for the warmth).
If you want to get helmet/jodhpurs/gloves/whatever, it is usually possible to purchase them in the riding schools in Zurich if you want to try them on and there are no specialised shops around. 
It is not possible to guess the correct size of the helmet (needs to be the smallest one that feels comfortable), if you want to buy them online, best to buy several and return the wrong sizes.

* ALSACE * 
The easiest in terms of transport from Zurich, you can take a train to Strasbourg (easy connection in Basel), then a lift from Strasbourg railway station.

* NORMANDIE *
150 km from Paris, "les chevaux sont tr√®s gentilles", emphasis on the gastronomy.
You have to come to the equestrian centre on Friday, so probably the best option is to catch a 18:10 (Air France) or 18:50 (Swiss) flight from Zurich, 
than a train to Rouen (last train at 22h05 from St.Lazare, you should be able to make it).

* AQUITAINE *
A bit warmer, "au bord de la mer". 
You would need to fly to Bordeaux (18:10, Air France, comfortable connection in CdG), then probably a either a taxi or a night in Bordeaux and 7h11 - 9h05 train to Soulac, in which case you would be late, need to check with the organisers, probably ok.

* OTHER OPTIONS *
RANDO CHEVAL list http://www.randocheval.com/debutants.htm - other options seems to require longer journeys and/or are longer than a week-end.
Plenty of options in Camargue, but it takes longer to get there from Zurich.

** WHO? **
Usually there week-ends are 10-15 people max, so you cannot bring all of your team! even if more fresh air and fewer abstractions could do them good.
The average size of RANDO CHEVAL groups are 4-5 people this time of the year.
I am happy to tag along, never done the whole week-end before and can use it a Zurich meeting do-over and also as an excuse to drop on my friends on Paris; but I can do it another time, no problem at all.
